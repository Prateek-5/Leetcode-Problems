/*
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

 

Example 1:


Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
Example 2:

Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.
Example 3:

Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are 2 elements in original.
It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.

🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Check if conversion is possible
if(original.size() != m*n) return {};


The number of elements in the 1D array must exactly match the total number of elements in the m × n matrix.

If not, we immediately return an empty 2D vector.

✅ Reason:
You can’t reshape a vector into a matrix if the total number of elements doesn’t match.

Step 2: Initialize a 2D vector
vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n));


This creates a 2D vector result with:

m rows

n columns

Initially, all elements are default-initialized to 0.

✅ Example:
If m = 2 and n = 3, this line creates:

result = [
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]

Step 3: Fill the 2D matrix
for(int i = 0; i < original.size(); i++) {
    int row = i / n;
    int col = i % n;
    result[row][col] = original[i];
}


Here’s the key logic.

We iterate over each element in the 1D vector original, and map its index i to a (row, column) in the 2D matrix.

row = i / n → Integer division gives the row index.

col = i % n → Modulus gives the column index within that row.

Then, we assign:

result[row][col] = original[i];


✅ Example:
If original = [1,2,3,4,5,6] and m=2, n=3:

i	original[i]	row = i/n	col = i%n	result[row][col]
0	1	0	0	result[0][0] = 1
1	2	0	1	result[0][1] = 2
2	3	0	2	result[0][2] = 3
3	4	1	0	result[1][0] = 4
4	5	1	1	result[1][1] = 5
5	6	1	2	result[1][2] = 6

Final result:

[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6]
]

✅ Step 4: Return the result
return result;


The fully constructed 2D matrix is returned.

⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(m * n)
(We visit each element once)

Space Complexity: O(m * n)
(We create a new 2D vector of size m × n)

🧾 Summary of Approach
Step	Action	Purpose
1	Check if original.size() == m * n	Ensure reshape is possible
2	Initialize 2D vector result	Create space for the new matrix
3	Map each element from 1D → 2D	Use row = i/n, col = i%n
4	Return result	Return the constructed matrix
