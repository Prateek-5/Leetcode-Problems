/*
Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the number of special positions in mat.

A position (i, j) is called special if mat[i][j] == 1 and all other elements in row i and column j are 0 (rows and columns are 0-indexed).

 

Example 1:


Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: (1, 2) is a special position because mat[1][2] == 1 and all other elements in row 1 and column 2 are 0.
Example 2:


Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: (0, 0), (1, 1) and (2, 2) are special positions.
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
    mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
